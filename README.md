# my-html-project

This is a simple HTML website I created while learning HTML. It was fun and exciting to work with Html. 

The website uses only HTML and the CSS is copied. 

Hope you like it. 

In the future, I will be creating new repositories with websites including HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

Thanks.
